# KnapsackProblemOptimization
This project focuses on the optimization of the Knapsack problem using multiple algorithmic techniques.

# Description:

The Knapsack problem is a classic optimization problem where given a set of items with their weights and values, we aim to select a combination of items that maximizes the total value while respecting a given weight constraint.

This repository contains implementations of various algorithms to tackle the Knapsack problem efficiently. The following techniques have been implemented and are available in this project:

# Branch & Bound Technique:

The Branch & Bound technique is a systematic approach that divides the problem into smaller subproblems and uses bounds to prune branches that are not optimal. It guarantees an optimal solution for the Knapsack problem.

# Total Value Greedy:

The Total Value Greedy approach selects items based on their total value, prioritizing items with higher values. It is a heuristic technique that provides a fast but not necessarily optimal solution.

# Greedy Weight:

The Greedy Weight technique selects items based on their weight, choosing items with lower weights first. It is another heuristic approach that provides a quick but suboptimal solution.

# Gray Wolf Optimization Algorithm:

The Gray Wolf Optimization Algorithm is a metaheuristic algorithm inspired by the hunting behavior of gray wolves. It mimics the social hierarchy and hunting patterns of wolves to optimize the Knapsack problem.

# Tabu Search:

Tabu Search is a metaheuristic algorithm that explores the search space by moving from one solution to another based on certain criteria. It uses memory structures to prevent revisiting previously explored solutions.

# Greedy Profit:

The Greedy Profit technique selects items based on their profit, prioritizing items with higher profits. It is another heuristic approach that provides a quick but suboptimal solution.

# Extended Efficiency:

The Extended Efficiency technique combines both weight and profit factors to select items. It calculates the efficiency ratio of each item and chooses items with higher efficiency ratios.

# Greedy Efficiency:

The Greedy Efficiency technique selects items based on their efficiency ratio, which is calculated as the ratio of profit to weight. It prioritizes items with higher efficiency ratios.

# Genetic Algorithm:

The Genetic Algorithm is a population-based metaheuristic inspired by the principles of natural selection and genetics. It evolves a population of candidate solutions to find an optimal or near-optimal solution for the Knapsack problem.

# Each algorithmic technique is implemented using Python programming language, providing a clear and modular code structure. The repository includes detailed explanations, documentation, and usage examples for each algorithm to aid understanding and facilitate experimentation.
